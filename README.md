# Principles and Tools of Advanced Web Development
This repository contains all code and resources for the NCSSM Principles and Tools of Advanced Web Development Forum, hosted first semester for 2022.

## Respository Structure
- `/resources` - Contains resources that might be useful when creating your own projects.
- `week-<num>` - Folders that contain the code for that week. Weeks that do not have a folder do not require code.
